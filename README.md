## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a iOS Developer, Swift Enthusiast Extraordinaire. I love creating apps that solve problems and bring delightful user experiences.

## About Me 🙋

I'm passionate about mobile development although I am still learning Kotlin 🤦.  I also take an interest into machine learning. I have over 3 years experience working with Swift, and I have successfully launch Nutrify: Whole Food Tracker onto the App Store.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin + Jetpack compose, and always improving my Swift
