## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a iOS Developer, Swift Enthusiast Extraordinaire. I love creating apps that solve problems and bring delightful user experiences.

## About Me 🙋

I'm passionate about mobile development although I am still learning Kotlin 🤦.  I also take an interest into machine learning. I have over 3 years experience working with Swift, and I have successfully launch Nutrify: Whole Food Tracker onto the App Store.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin + Jetpack compose, and always improving my Swift


## App Showcase 📱

### Nutrify: Whole Food Tracker 🤳 → 🍍
Nutirfy makes learning about food as easy as taking a photo. From discovering new foods to understanding the nutrition of foods you eat every day, Nutrify simplifies the process. 

Instead of scanning barcodes or deciphering food packing labels, Nutrify focuses on whole foods 🍍 foods you could grow in your own backyard, find at a local market or prepare in your kitchen.

With over 500+ foods to discover and learn about 📖, Nutrify makes learning about food fun and engaging.

## Project Showcase ⚙️

### Swifty Wizards 🧙
Swifty Wizards has been a little passion project of mine. Here I have been experimenting using Apples SpriteKit to handle the game logic, then layering over Swifts, SwiftUI to handle the games UI. This has been interesting for several reasons.

1. Handling the game state as well as SwiftUI's state.

Changes to `@State`, `@Binding` or any SwiftUI publisher value for that matter would ironically also interfere with the games state. For example even updating a bool would reset the game causing the scene to be re-rendered.

2. Learning SpriteKit and Collisions

Moving from SwiftUI to learn SpriteKit, I was excited at first. But then I learn how to make a button and the excitement slowly dwindled
